# POC for Scripting with Apex

## Scripting with Apex?
Ok. Not really. What I'm talking about is using Execute Anonymous as a de facto scripting tool in conjunction with Salesforce DX CLI and the DX workflow. 

## Resources
For examples, check in the `apexscripts` directory. 

FYI, .apxs is not an officially sanctioned file extension for SFDX. But I like it so I'm using it.
